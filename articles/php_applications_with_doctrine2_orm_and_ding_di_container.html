  <H3><u>PHP Applications with a Persistence Layer, Dependency Injection, and Aspect Oriented Programming</u></H3>
  <p>
This article will show how we can develop software in php with a nifty design and architecture, and very much
like other languages like java, using an ORM and an AOP, DI, Events container. I will assume you've read (or at least took a quick look) at
<a href="creating_php_cli_standalone_portable_applications_with_pear_dependencies.html">"<b>Creating isolated environments for PHP applications with PEAR dependencies</b></a> that explains
the tree layout used throughout the code, and that you have some basic knowledge of <a href="http://www.doctrine-project.org/">Doctrine2</a> and used it before on your
own.
</p>
<p>
You can find a similar article with a telephony application example for the Asterisk PBX in <a href="php_asterisk_listener_example_using_pami_and_ding.html">"<b>Create VoIP applications for Asterisk using PHP, PAMI, and Ding</b>"</a>.
</p>
<p>
Doctrine2 has proven to be a great thing to have around for your applications. I'd like to show how <a href="http://marcelog.github.com/Ding">Ding</a> can also
be one of those good things to use in your projects. So in this example, we'll use Doctrine2 as the orm of a sample application, and use Ding as a
container to provide the glue (events, aspect oriented programming, dependency injection, and inversion of control) throughout all of the code.
  </p>
  <p>
You can find the complete source code for this article at <a href="https://github.com/marcelog/Doctrine2-Ding-Example">GitHub.</a>
  </p>
<p>
I'll try to go step by step. Please bare with me as I go along the article trying to explain what is going on. Hopefully, the pieces
will fit together as you go down the article. It's recommended that you read <a href="http://marcelog.github.com/articles/ding_how_to_install_configure_tutorial_introduction.html">this</a> if you dont know how to download and install ding.
</p>
<h3><u>Obtaining a tiered architecture in your PHP Applications</u></h3>
<ul>
<li>A software architecture based on PHP <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Bean">beans</a>, leading to very decoupled code, orchestrated by the container (ding).</li>
<li>Lots of boiler plate procedural code transformed into declarative code, in the bean definitions (like doctrine setup
and aquirement of needed dependencies)</li>
<li>Our resulting application will have 1 entity, the User.</li>
<li>A "User" domain service, that can return a User given an id, and also can create a "User" with
a given username and password.</li>
<li>We will use an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event-driven_programming">event driven</a> (let's call our events, "domain events"), approach to
extend our application, in this case we will create a domain event "newUserCreated", dispatched for each "User" created in the system.</li>
<li>A listener of "newUserCreated" that will log the username created via debug level.</li>
<li>We will apply <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspect-oriented_programming">AOP</a> to create 2 aspects in the system, a "Profiler"
aspect that can keep track of the time spent in each domain service, and a "Transactional" aspect, that will
call beginTransaction()-flush()-commit()-rollback() on the doctrine entity manager in nested domain services calls, so our domain services wont have to.</li>
</ul>
<p>
A sample log of the creation of the username "john":
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/marcelog/a197e4d900dd9cb5fda3baa531fdd0e9.js"></script>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/marcelog/5714145f5ca245646456c3cedf9f5ada.js"></script>
<p>
You can see the "Transactional" aspect managing the per-domain-service-method-call
transactions. Also, you can spot 2 transactions being made: one is for the call to createUser, and the
other one is for the call to getById (we can see that because of the "Profiler" aspect accounting
the time spent in each one of the calls). These calls are not nested, they are issued
per separate.
</p>
<p>
Also, notice the "New user: john" message, logged by the event listener for the event
"newUserCreated" after the container logged a debug message when dispatching the event.

<h4><u>The code</u></h4>
<p>
Let's take a quick review of the resuling code first, the code is kind of self explanatory
and will let you discover "the magic" behind it before I get into any gory details. If I can still have you interested after that, I'll show
how to setup the container and the orm later :)
</p>
<p>
The User entity can be something standard, you can find it <a href="https://github.com/marcelog/Doctrine2-Ding-Example/blob/master/src/php/Domain/Entity/User.php">here</a>.
</p>
<h4><u>Our beans</u></h4>
<p>
So whenever a User is persist()ed, we would have this bean listening for the domain
event "newUserCreated". We declare beans with annotations like @Component, @Aspect,
@Configuration, @Controller, etc:
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/marcelog/e30f8c973ddd25ba0b8c1bdb419337ff.js"></script>
<p>
Another bean: the user domain service, that will create User entities, persist them, and dispatch the
"newUserCreated" event. This one is also a @Component, but it specifies a name for itself,
"userDomainService" (note the @Resource annotation, that wires-by-name the indicated dependency):
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/marcelog/c89f238e2d3d3ac0f12bf39ac1333a15.js"></script>
<p>
Components can extend other components, so the bean definitions can extend other
bean definitions. The parent class for all domain services will ensure that every domain service
has a logger and the "entityManager" always injected (note again the @Resource
annotation, that wires-by-name the indicated dependency):
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/marcelog/273ee875abef7df137e783a2155f795e.js"></script>
<p>
A programatically bean definition for the repository. All components can be a source
for bean definitions. @Configuration annotated classes are specifically used for this
purpose. It will be injected with the entityManager itself. Each @Bean annotated method
is a bean whose name is the method's name.
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/marcelog/ffa55f1d025ed4e65089392e3b298000.js"></script>
<p>
The method "userRepository" is a bean definition that will be injected in the
user domain service, in the "userRepository" property (because of the @Resource
annotation that wires by name). You can find the code for the repository <a href="https://github.com/marcelog/Doctrine2-Ding-Example/blob/master/src/php/Domain/Repository/User.php">here</a>.
</p>
<p>
The Profiler aspect mentioned above, just another component (bean). Notice the
@Aspect and @MethodInterceptor annotations:
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/marcelog/b7d2ea65e50bf16b1ffae4043a573dd0.js"></script>
<p>And last but not least, the "Transactional" aspect, that will call flush() in the
entityManager to commit changes to DB, mantaining transactions when having nested domain services
calls. To do it, it will count the number of nested calls, on the first one, the transaction will
be started. The counter will decrease with every return'ing function, so when this counter
goes to 1 again, the transactions is commited:
</p>

<H3><u>Running your PHP Applications</u></H3>
<p>
Well, that really is all. Just wanted to make a point on how we can actually do better
applications using PHP. As you can see, the container handles everything needed to glue the application
together, and every part of the system can do just what it needs to do, leading to
more concise software and better practices over time. Of course this is a trivial example, but
it can be applied without effort to more complex software.
</p>
<p>You can get the complete source code <a href="https://github.com/marcelog/Doctrine2-Ding-Example">here</a>.
What follows, is an overview of how to structure this kind of applications, and where everything goes. The config details
and bootstrapping stuff, and basically, how everything works. I hope you liked it and that you're still
interested in continue your reading :)
</p>
<H3><u>Setting up your Application</u></H3>
<p>
So we'll start with the very same application <a href="creating_php_cli_standalone_portable_applications_with_pear_dependencies.html">mentioned earlier, here.</a>
</p>
<p>
Our config/setup/dependencies file will need to look like:
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/marcelog/a090454361950a426f0f19734134c0ae.js"></script>

<p>
<a href="http://logging.apache.org/log4php/Log4Php">Log4php</a> is needed by Ding, it will be used to log messages in your application and the container itself.
</p>
<p>
Also, let's add a new directory to the tree layout, the runtime directory:
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/marcelog/d52fe872a7b38b55649b0a0b1760c1cc.js"></script>

<p>
runtime/log will of course hold the log files. runtime/db will hold the database (I've used sqlite3 in this
particular application).
</p>
<p>
runtime/cache will hold all the files that ding and doctrine might need to generate (also, we could store
our generated repositories and entities).
</p>
<h3><u>The bootstrap of the Dependency Injection Container</u></h3>
<p>Now we have to bootstrap the container for our application, this of course will be
done in the bin/bootstrap.php file of the sample tree layout. The comments will explain what is going on:
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/marcelog/6351b52e524a06517cc399972b780730.js"></script>
<H3><u>Application Configuration</u></H3>
<p>So I've mentioned a config/application.properties file, used to configure the application. Let's take a look at it, it should be self explanatory:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/marcelog/8913816bfd611f5f641c1777c60e3441.js"></script>
<H3><u>Ding and Doctrine Configuration</u></H3>
<p>So how do these properties end up configuring everything? This is where the container
comes into action. Remember we specified that we're going to be using a file, config/support/beans.xml
as a bean provider. Let's take a look at that file:
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/marcelog/90073ba4f6ff9a4e6bc0ae35fd19355c.js"></script>
<p>
Let's now take a look at the config/support/doctrine.xml file. This will configure
doctrine not programatically but as a series of bean definitions. This is the equivalent of
the <a href="http://www.doctrine-project.org/docs/orm/2.0/en/reference/configuration.html#obtaining-an-entitymanager">this code</a>.Everything like
${..} is replaced by the container with the appropiate values coming in from the
config/application.properties file:
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/marcelog/e6e3ba1fce275374b97ad902b6181255.js"></script>
<h3><u>Running the Doctrine CLI (your Persistence Layer)</u></h3>
<p>
Since our application has its own isolated environment, we need our own shell script to call
the right doctrine cli (the one in our vendors directory). So we run bin/doctrine.sh:
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/marcelog/6aa4ab096922a519765168a5a4dcff35.js"></script>
<h3><u>Running the example</u></h3>
<p>
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/marcelog/4bc620efac72479e851d081219867b95.js"></script>
