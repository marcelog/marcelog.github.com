  <title>The Asterisk Manager Interface (AMI) Protocol</title>
  
  </head>
  <body>
  <H1><u>Introduction</u></H1>
<p>
The <b>Asterisk Manager Interface</b> (<b>AMI</b>) protocol is a very simple protocol that allows you to 
communicate and manage your asterisk server, almost completely. It has support to edit/create asterisk configuration
files and also manage the calls, clients, agents, dialplan, etc.

  <H1><u>Overview of the AMI Protocol</u></H1>
  <p>
AMI is a plain text protocol, and it works by sending and receiving packets. Each packet consists in a series
of text lines delimited by <b>\r\n</b>. And each packet is delimited by <b>\r\n\r\n</b>. 
AMI uses a tcp port configured in <b>manager.conf</b>. As soon as the connection is established, asterisk salutes you with something like:<br/>
<hr/>
Asterisk Call Manager/1.1
<hr/>
This message indicates that the communication can begin. Packets may be transmitted in either direction at any time after authentication.
</p>
<H1><u>AMI Packets (Actions, Responses, Events)</u></H1>
  <p>
  AMI defines 3 kind of possible packets:<br/>
  <ul>
  <li><u>Actions</u>: This kind of packet is what the client sends. Only the client can generate Actions.</li>
  <li><u>Responses</u>: Actions have at least one Response, indicating the result of the executed (or requested) action.</li>
  <li><u>Events</u>: There are two kind of events. The ones attached to a particular response for a particular action, and
  the ones that asterisk generate to inform the connected client about things that are happening in the server (like
  call events, changes in variables values, agents and other clients that connect/disconnect to/from the server, etc).</li>
  </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
  The first line of a packet will have a key of "Action" when sent from the client to Asterisk, but "Event" or "Response" when sent from Asterisk to the client.
  </p>
<p>
A typical action is the <b>Login</b> action, which looks like this:<br/>
<hr/>
Action: Login\r\n<br/>
Username: admin\r\n<br/>
Secret: mysecret\r\n<br/>
ActionId: 1a2b\r\n<br/>
\r\n<br/>
<hr/>
And its response is something like:<br/>
<hr/>
Response: Success\r\n<br/>
ActionID: 1a2b\r\n<br/>
Message: Authentication accepted\r\n<br/>
\r\n
<hr/>

google_ad_client = "ca-pub-6947936742546167";

google_ad_slot = "1974587443";

<p>
Notice the <b>ActionId</b> field in the action and response packet. This field is optional, but highly recommended to send, because it tells asterisk to respond with this same actionid value
so the client can easily associate the response with the action sent. If any events are attached to this response, they
will also contain the same actionid value.
</p>
<p>
So the general format for an action packet is something like this:<br/>
<hr/>
Action: &lt;action&gt;\r\n<br/>
&lt;Key1&gt;: &lt;value&gt;\r\n<br/>
&lt;Key2&gt;: &lt;value&gt;\r\n<br/>
...<br/>
&lt;KeyN&gt;: &lt;value&gt;\r\n<br/>
Variable: &lt;name&gt;=&lt;value&gt;<br/>
Variable: &lt;name&gt;=&lt;value&gt;<br/>
...<br/>
Variable: &lt;name&gt;=&lt;value&gt;<br/>
<hr/>
Different actions require different <b>keys</b> and/or <b>variables</b>. You can find the complete list
of actions <a href="https://wiki.asterisk.org/wiki/display/AST/AMI+Actions">here</a>.
