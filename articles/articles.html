                <div class="hr-1"><hr /></div>
<p>
In a <a href="installing_webrtc2sip_in_amazon_linux_in_aws.html">previous article</a> I described how to install <a href="http://webrtc2sip.org/"><b>Webrtc2sip</b></a> to include SIP signalling in your
<a href="http://www.webrtc.org/"><b>webrtc</b></a> applications. Unluckily there were some issues with webrtc2sip reported by <a href="https://twitter.com/RosSantoro1">Rosario Santoro (@RosSantoro1)</a> and further discussed in the
<a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/doubango/oPpXlSRcz2E">Doubango Google Group</a>. Without having a solution yet, I decided to give Asterisk another shot. So in this article I'll describe how to use
Asterisk only (without webrtc2sip) to setup a webrtc scenario without any other third party applications. This article is loosely based on <a href="http://manuals.loway.ch/QM_AdvancedConfig-chunked/ch25.html">this one</a>.

                <h2>Compiling and Installing WebRTC2SIP</h2>
                <div class="hr-1"><hr /></div>
<p>
A lot of sources around the Internet explain how to <b>compile and install</b> <a href="http://webrtc2sip.org/"><b>Webrtc2sip</b></a> so one can have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_Initiation_Protocol">SIP</a> as the signaling protocol in
a <a href="http://www.webrtc.org/"><b>webrtc</b></a> application, mostly in conjunction with <a href="http://www.asterisk.org"><b>Asterisk</b></a> and/or <a href="http://www.freeswitch.org"><b>FreeSWITCH</b></a>.
Most of the time those instructions are outdated or incomplete, so here is the updated way of <b>installing webrtc2sip</b> and its dependencies, using <b>Amazon Linux</b> in an
<b>EC2 instance</b> inside <b>AWS</b>, altough I'm pretty sure this could also be used for any <b>CentOS</b> like OS.

<a href="http://cr.yp.to/daemontools.html/"><b>DaemonTools</b></a> is an excellent piece of software created by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_J._Bernstein">Daniel J. Bernstein</a>, and composed of several tools
used to launch and monitor processes in a unix environment. They are fast, reliable, and are my favourites whenever I get to wear the devops hat to setup a new server. Sadly, there's no default package
available for distros like Amazon Linux or CentOS, so here are the steps involved for setting them up manually.

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augmented_Backus%E2%80%93Naur_Form"><b>ABNF grammars</b></a> are widely used in the Internet today.
They serve as the basic building blocks for a lot of highly used protocols, like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol"><b>HTTP</b></a>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_Initiation_Protocol"><b>SIP</b></a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Mail_Transfer_Protocol"><b>SMTP</b></a>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Transfer_Protocol"><b>FTP</b></a>, etc. And they are also very useful to design <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language">DSLs</a>
(Domain Specific Language).
In this article we'll learn how to use a tool called <a href="https://github.com/marcelog/ex_abnf"><b>ex_abnf</b></a> to quickly

we can also get some "nicer" graphs for our <b>erlang projects</b>, integrated with <a href="http://jenkins-ci.org">Jenkins</a>, by using <a href="https://github.com/idubrov/covertool">covertool</a> to convert the coverage information into the <a href="http://cobertura.sourceforge.net/">cobertura</a> format

Hello again! To continue the "Every Day Erlang" series, I'd like to show you how to implement a quick and simple (yet effective) cache using ets, very suitable to wrap your expensive function calls with it.

As a developer, one of the things that really keeps me motivated is to know where I'm going.
This means that the short and medium term objectives are clear (by whoever might be in charge of gathering requirements or making the specs), and in a somewhat detailed way.
This makes it possible (again, as a developer) to make your work flow from one day to the other in a more natural way, mentally planning what you want to accomplish "today" in
your trip to the office, and plan "tomorrow" as you work your way to the end of the day &nbsp;<a href="a_plan_is_not_only_good_for_business.html"><strong>Read More &raquo;</strong></a></p>

In this article, I'll describe <a href="https://github.com/marcelog/epers/">epers</a>, which is a
small project I've been working on. It's currently a "small" project, but quite ambitious, and the idea
is to try some "new" ideas and concepts in the erlang we do every day. epers stands for "<b>erlang persistence</b>".

I've shown how to unit test them, by using the mocked client pagi. Now, since version 1.10.0, PAGI comes with a neat feature, which is a small
abstraction layer over the pagi client, called "Nodes". Also, the "NodeController" will orchestrate how those nodes interact with each other.

                <h2>Sniffing in PHP using libpcap: Thank you SWIG!</h2>
                <div class="hr-1"><hr /></div>
                <p>I've been wanting to try <a href="http://www.swig.org/">SWIG</a> for a long time, but never got the chance, for one
thing or the other. So this weekend I've finally decided to give it a try by trying to create a php extension
that access a small C++ wrapper for libpcap, so I can sniff packets directly from PHP. Just for fun (and actually because
I couldn't find any active pecl extension to use libpcap, so it might as well be something useful). I've named it "SimplePcap". &nbsp;<a href="swig_php_libpcap_module_c++.html"><strong>Read More &raquo;</strong></a></p>
                <h2>Dispatching and listening for events in the Ding container</h2>
                <div class="hr-1"><hr /></div>
                <p>Events in the ding container are strings. This is not a great level of abstraction but still provides a powerful
tool to work with. Events also have associated data, sent to the listeners as an argument when firing the event. This
simple workflow will allow you to extend your system with autonomous components that react to events, totally decoupled
from the rest of the code. &nbsp;<a href="ding_event_listen_dispatch_bean.html"><strong>Read More &raquo;</strong></a></p>
                <h2>Ding annotations for dependency injection</h2>
                <div class="hr-1"><hr /></div>
                <p>In the <a href="http://marcelog.github.com/articles/ding_component_bean_annotations.html">previous article</a> I've shown how to declare
your beans. Now it's time to see how to achieve DI (dependency injection), also using annotations. &nbsp;<a href="ding_component_bean_annotations_di_dependency_injection.html"><strong>Read More &raquo;</strong></a></p>

                <div class="hr-1"><hr /></div>
                <p>Everything shown here using annotations, is also available by using the XML and YAML bean definition providers, so you are
free to use any of the 3 drivers (XML, YAML, Annotations) to define your beans and mix them anyway you like or need to &nbsp;<a href="ding_component_bean_annotations.html"><strong>Read More &raquo;</strong></a></p>

                <div class="hr-1"><hr /></div>
                <p>Sometimes it's useful (or needed) to have the container call certain methods right before injecting (or giving
away) our beans, and right before destructing it, as a way of setup-teardown or init-shutdown. Ding provides a way to execute code in some of the points &nbsp;<a href="ding_bean_lifecycle_init_destroy_post_construct.html"><strong>Read More &raquo;</strong></a></p>

<a href="http://marcelog.github.com/Ding/">the ding container</a>. The article ended with getting a container instance, but didn't show how to actually define and use your
